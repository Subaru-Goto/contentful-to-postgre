  ingredients: [
    ' Freshly ground black pepper, to taste',
    'Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving',
    '1 cup Arborio rice',
    '1/2 cup dry white wine',
    '1 small onion, finely chopped',
    '2 cloves garlic, minced',
    '1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes',
    '3 cups vegetable or chicken broth, kept warm',
    '2 tablespoons olive oil',
    '1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped'
  ],
  method: [
    'In a saucepan, heat the vegetable or chicken broth over low heat to keep it warm.',
    'In a large pan or skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion and sauté until it becomes translucent.',
    'Add the minced garlic and Arborio rice to the pan. Stir well to coat the rice with the oil and sauté for 1-2 minutes until the rice is lightly toasted.',
    'Pour in the white wine and cook, stirring continuously, until most of the liquid is absorbed.',
    'Add the crushed tomatoes to the rice mixture. Stir well and cook for a couple of minutes.',
    'Begin adding the warm broth, one ladle at a time, to the rice. Stir constantly and allow the liquid to be absorbed before adding the next ladle. Continue this process until the rice is cooked al dente, which usually takes about 18-20 minutes.',
    'Once the rice is cooked, stir in the grated Parmesan cheese and chopped fresh basil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If the risotto is too thick, you can add a bit more warm broth.',
    'Remove the risotto from the heat and let it rest for a couple of minutes.',
    'Serve the tomato and basil risotto hot, garnished with additional Parmesan and basil if desired.'
